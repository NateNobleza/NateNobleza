#### About me

    When I'm not doing any code, you can catch me gaming! Currently playing Valorant, CS2, LOL, and TFT
    Some of my other hobbies include building computers and keyboards (currently have 7 keyboards in rotation)
    That is how my spark for being a software engineer stemmed from, so if you have any similar interest
