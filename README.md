#### About me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NateNobleza
Full-Stack Web Developer | JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React, PostgreSQL, Express.js, Node.js
When I'm not doing any code, you can catch me gaming! Currently playing Valorant, CS2, LOL, and TFT
Some of my other hobbies include building computers and keyboards (currently have 7 keyboards in rotation)
That is how my spark for being a software engineer stemmed from, so if you have any similar interest
lets have a chat!
